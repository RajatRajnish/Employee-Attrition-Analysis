# Employee-Attrition-Analysis

# Project Overview: 
The Employee Attrition Analysis project aims to explore and analyze factors contributing to employee attrition within an organization. By leveraging data visualization and statistical techniques, this project identifies key trends, patterns, and potential drivers of employee turnover. The insights derived can assist HR departments in improving retention strategies and fostering a better work environment.

# Key Objectives

Understand Attrition Trends – Analyze the rate and reasons behind employee attrition.

Identify Key Influencing Factors – Determine which variables (salary, job satisfaction, work-life balance, etc.) most impact attrition.

Visualize Insights – Present findings through clear and actionable visualizations.

Provide Recommendations – Suggest data-driven strategies to reduce attrition.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 10,000 employee records with 26 attributes, including:

Demographics: Age, Gender, Marital Status

Job-related: Department, Job Role, Monthly Income, Years at Company

Performance Metrics: Job Satisfaction, Performance Rating, Training Hours

Work Conditions: Overtime, Work-Life Balance, Relationship with Manager

Attrition Status: Whether the employee left (Yes/No)

# Methodology
1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
Checked for missing values (none found).

Verified data types and corrected where necessary (e.g., converting object types to strings).

Analyzed unique values in categorical columns (e.g., Departments, Job Roles).

2. Descriptive Analysis
Examined average salary by job role (Managers, Assistants, Analysts, Executives).

Evaluated job satisfaction levels across different roles.

Assessed gender distribution (almost equal representation).

3. Data Visualization
Key Visualizations:
Average Salary by Job Role

Bar Chart: Revealed that Managers and Executives have the highest average salaries, while Assistants earn the least.

Insight: Compensation disparities may influence attrition in lower-paying roles.

Job Satisfaction by Job Role

Bar Chart: Showed that Executives report the highest job satisfaction, while Assistants have the lowest.

Insight: Job satisfaction correlates with job role and may impact retention.

Gender Distribution

Count Plot: Confirmed a balanced gender distribution (50.42% Female, 49.58% Male).

Insight: Gender does not appear to be a significant factor in attrition.


# Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook (Data Cleaning, Analysis, Visualization)

Statistical Analysis (Descriptive & Inferential Techniques)

# Conclusion
This analysis highlights compensation, job role, and work conditions as key drivers of employee attrition. By addressing these factors, organizations can improve retention, reduce turnover costs, and enhance workforce stability. Future work could involve predictive modeling to forecast attrition risks and tailor retention strategies more effectively.
